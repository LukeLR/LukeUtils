Hey folks, I need to consult you again since I'm stuck with the following problem:

To provide logging abilities to all my project, I use a selfmade library for logging, which includes static methods for access from all classes and objects, and also an ability to dump the log contents to a file on exit. This worked well for years now, now I need to extend the library to provide a function to use several "log channels", which each represent individual logs. Each log channel is an instance of the class "Log" (see below), and then added to a list (as in class ListTest3, see below). But when trying to get a specific log from the list by creating a dummy object which has the same channel name, always `-1` is returned, indicating that no object could be found. Why?

class Log:

    public class Log {
      //...
      
      public String getChannel(){
        return channel;
      }
      
      //...
      
      public boolean equals(Log compare){
        // return getChannel().equals(compare.getChannel());
        return true;
      
        /**
         * used to contain a method to compare the channel names of the log
         * object itself and the provided object for comparison, now always
         * returns true for debugging purposes
         */
      }
      
      //...
    }

For debugging, I created the following class ListTest3:

    package test;
    
    import java.util.List;
    import java.util.LinkedList;
    
    import logging.Log;
    
    public class ListTest3 {
      public static void main(String[] args){
        List list = new LinkedList();
        Log logDefault = new Log();
        logDefault.setChannel("default");
        Log logAdvanced = new Log();
        logAdvanced.setChannel("advanced");
        Log logDebug = new Log();
        logDebug.setChannel("debug");
        
        list.add(logDefault);
        list.add(logAdvanced);
        list.add(logDebug);
        
        System.out.println("Index of logDefault: " + list.indexOf(logDefault));
        System.out.println("Index of logAdvanced: " + list.indexOf(logAdvanced));
        System.out.println("Index of logDebug: " + list.indexOf(logDebug));
        
        Log logDefaultDummy = new Log();
        logDefaultDummy.setChannel("default");
        System.out.println("Index of logDefaultDummy: " + list.indexOf(logDefaultDummy));
        
        Log logAdvancedDummy = new Log();
        logAdvancedDummy.setChannel("advanced");
        System.out.println("Index of logAdvancedDummy: " + list.indexOf(logAdvancedDummy));
        
        Log logDebugDummy = new Log();
        logDebugDummy.setChannel("debug");
        System.out.println("Index of logDebugDummy: " + list.indexOf(logDebugDummy));
      }
    }

But instead of returning the indices of the three log objects when searching the list by their dummies, always `-1` is returned, as the following output shows:

    Index of logDefault: 0
    Index of logAdvanced: 1
    Index of logDebug: 2
    Index of logDefaultDummy: -1
    Index of logAdvancedDummy: -1
    Index of logDebugDummy: -1

Any help is very appreciated, since I don't know how to fix this problem. Thanks for reading that batch of text! ;)
